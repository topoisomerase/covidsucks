          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>Solidarity is a student-run website that connects Friends in need of resources with Friends that have them during the COVID-19 pandemic. We guide you through each step so you can easily pick up food, toiletries, and medical supplies, or have them dropped off at your doorstep.</p>

          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p><strong>If you are in need of supplies,</strong> you can search for what people are already offering in your area, or if you can't find what you need, you can post a request. Once your request is accepted, you will coordinate a pick-up or drop-off time and you'll have your goods!</p>

          <p><strong>If you want to donate supplies,</strong> you can search for what people are requesting in your area or post what you are offering.</p>

          <p>Once you receive a request, you will coordinate a pick-up or drop-off time with the person you're helping and make their day!</p>

          <p><strong>We want to limit physical interactions between requesters and helpers as much as possible,</strong> so please be careful when handling items. Wash your hands, use gloves, and disinfect before and after retrieving and dropping so you can off resources.</p>
